# Send App Usage Permission

After WWDC 2019 Apple [updated](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#5.1) the App Store Guidelines 
> Guideline 5.1.1(i). Apps must get consent for data collection, even if the data is considered anonymous at the time of or immediately following collection.

> (ii) Permission Apps that collect user or usage data must secure user consent for the collection, **even if such data is considered to be anonymous** at the time of or immediately following collection.

Inspired [WWDC App](https://itunes.apple.com/app/wwdc/id640199958?mt=8) I made class to help developers & community save time and comply with the App Store Guidelines.
